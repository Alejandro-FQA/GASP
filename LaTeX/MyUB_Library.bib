  abstract = {Physical reservoir computing (RC) is a machine learning algorithm that employs the dynamics of a physical system to forecast highly nonlinear and chaotic phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a quantum RC system that employs the dynamics of a probed atom in a cavity. The atom experiences coherent driving at a particular rate, leading to a measurement-controlled quantum evolution. The proposed quantum reservoir can make fast and reliable forecasts using a small number of artificial neurons compared with the traditional RC algorithm. We theoretically validate the operation of the reservoir, demonstrating its potential to be used in error-tolerant applications, where approximate computing approaches may be used to make feasible forecasts in conditions of limited computational and energy resources.},

  abstract = {We introduce a quantum geometric tensor in a curved space with a parameter-dependent metric, which contains the quantum metric tensor as the symmetric part and the Berry curvature corresponding to the antisymmetric part. This parameter-dependent metric modifies the usual inner product, which induces modifications in the quantum metric tensor and Berry curvature by adding terms proportional to the derivatives with respect to the parameters of the determinant of the metric. The quantum metric tensor is obtained in two ways: By using the definition of the infinitesimal distance between two states in the parameter-dependent curved space and via the fidelity susceptibility approach. The usual Berry connection acquires an additional term with which the curved inner product converts the Berry connection into an object that transforms as a connection and density of weight one. Finally, we provide three examples in one dimension with a nontrivial metric: an anharmonic oscillator, a Morse-like potential, and a generalized anharmonic oscillator; and one in two dimensions: the coupled anharmonic oscillator in a curved space.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing technologies are making steady progress. This has opened new opportunities for tackling problems whose complexity prevents their description on classical computers. A prototypical example of these complex problems are interacting quantum many-body systems: on the one hand, these systems are known to become rapidly prohibitive to describe using classical computers when their size increases. On the other hand, these systems are precisely those which are used in the laboratory to build quantum computing platforms. This arguably makes them one of the most promising early use cases of quantum computing. In this review, we explain how quantum many-body systems are used to build quantum processors, and how, in turn, current and future quantum processors can be used to describe large many-body systems of fermions such as electrons and nucleons. The review includes an introduction to analog and digital quantum devices, the mapping of Fermi systems and their Hamiltonians onto qubit registers, as well as an overview of methods to access their static and dynamical properties. We also highlight some aspects related to entanglement, and touch on the description, influence and processing of decoherence in quantum devices.},

However, most of the current implementations of ANNs and machine learning frameworks are using real numbers rather than complex numbers. There are growing interests in building ANNs using complex numbers, and exploring the potential advantages of the so called complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) over their real-valued counterparts. In this paper, we discuss the recent development of CVNNs by performing a survey of the works on CVNNs in the literature. Specifically, detailed review of various CVNNs in terms of activation function, learning and optimization, input and output representations, and their applications in tasks such as signal processing and computer vision are provided, followed by a discussion on some pertinent challenges and future research directions.},

Also closed quanto-mechanical systems may stop wandering freely around the whole Hilbert space, even if they are initially prepared into a macroscopically large combination of eigenstates. Here, we report numerical evidences that the dynamics of strongly interacting lattice bosons driven sufficiently far from equilibrium can be trapped into extremely long-lived inhomogeneous metastable states. The slowing down of incoherent density excitations above a threshold energy, much reminiscent of a dynamical arrest on the verge of a glass transition, is identified as the key feature of this phenomenon. We argue that the resulting long-lived inhomogeneities are responsible for the lack of thermalization observed in large systems. Such a rich phenomenology could be experimentally uncovered upon probing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of conveniently prepared quantum states of trapped cold atoms which we hereby suggest.},

A simple version is \$(A + iB){\textasciicircum}\{-1\} = (A + BA{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}B){\textasciicircum}\{-1\} - i A{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}B(A+BA{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} B){\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ when \$A\$ is invertible, which may be traced back to Frobenius but has received scant attention. We prove that it is optimal, requiring fewest matrix multiplications and inversions over the base field, and we extend it in three ways: (i) to any invertible \$A + iB\$ without requiring \$A\$ or \$B\$ be invertible; (ii) to any iterated quadratic extension fields, with \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}\$ over \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ a special case; (iii) to Hermitian positive definite matrices \$A + iB\$ by exploiting symmetric positive definiteness of \$A\$ and \$A + BA{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}B\$. We call all such algorithms Frobenius inversions, which we will see do not follow from Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury type identities and cannot be extended to Moore--Penrose pseudoinverse. We show that a complex matrix with well-conditioned real and imaginary parts can be arbitrarily ill-conditioned, a situation tailor-made for Frobenius inversion. We prove that Frobenius inversion for complex matrices is faster than standard inversion by LU decomposition and Frobenius inversion for Hermitian positive definite matrices is faster than standard inversion by Cholesky decomposition. We provide extensive numerical experiments, applying Frobenius inversion to solve linear systems, evaluate matrix sign function, solve Sylvester equation, and compute polar decomposition, showing that Frobenius inversion can be more efficient than LU/Cholesky decomposition with negligible loss in accuracy. A side result is a generalization of Gauss multiplication to iterated quadratic extensions, which we show is intimately related to the Karatsuba algorithm for fast integer multiplication and multidimensional fast Fourier transform.},

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

SPRING combines ideas from the recently introduced minimum-step stochastic reconfiguration optimizer (MinSR) and the classical randomized Kaczmarz method for solving linear least-squares problems. We demonstrate that SPRING outperforms both MinSR and the popular Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature method (KFAC) across a number of small atoms and molecules, given that the learning rates of all methods are optimally tuned. For example, on the oxygen atom, SPRING attains chemical accuracy after forty thousand training iterations, whereas both MinSR and KFAC fail to do so even after one hundred thousand iterations.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges of quantum many-body physics is the exponential growth in the dimensionality of the Hilbert space with system size. This growth makes solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation of the system extremely difficult. Nonetheless, many physical systems have a simplified internal structure that typically makes the parameters needed to characterize their ground states exponentially smaller. Many numerical methods then become available to capture the physics of the system. Among modern numerical techniques, neural networks, which show great power in approximating functions and extracting features of big data, are now attracting much interest. In this work, the progress in using artificial neural networks to build quantum many-body states is reviewed. The Boltzmann machine representation is taken as a prototypical example to illustrate various aspects of the neural network states. The classical neural networks are also briefly reviewed, and it is illustrated how to use neural networks to represent quantum states and density operators. Some physical properties of the neural network states are discussed. For applications, the progress in many-body calculations based on neural network states, the neural network state approach to tomography, and the classical simulation of quantum computing based on Boltzmann machine states are briefly reviewed.},

We first provide a formulation of the quantum geometrical tensor in the path integral formalism that can handle both the ground and excited states, making it useful to characterize excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPT). In this setting, we also generalize the quantum geometric tensor to incorporate variations of the system parameters and the phase-space coordinates. This gives rise to an alternative approach to the quantum covariance matrix, from which we can get information about the quantum entanglement of Gaussian states through tools such as purity and von Neumann entropy. Second, we demonstrate the equivalence between the formulation of the quantum geometric tensor in the path integral formalism and other existing methods. Furthermore, we explore the geometric properties of the generalized quantum metric tensor in depth by calculating the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature for several quantum systems, providing insight into this geometric information.},

We use an antisymmetric artificial neural network, or neural quantum state, as an Ansatz for the wave function and use machine learning techniques to variationally minimize the energy of systems from two to six particles. We provide extensive benchmarks for this toy model with other many-body methods, including exact diagonalization and the Hartree-Fock approximation. The neural quantum state provides the best energies across a wide range of interaction strengths. We find very different ground states depending on the sign of the interaction. In the nonperturbative repulsive regime, the system asymptotically reaches crystalline order. In contrast, the strongly attractive regime shows signs of bosonization. The neural quantum state continuously learns these different phases with an almost constant number of parameters and a very modest increase in computational time with the number of particles.},

We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states.

  abstract = {The representation of a quantum wave function as a neural network quantum state (NQS) provides a powerful variational ansatz for finding the ground states of many-body quantum systems. Nevertheless, due to the complex variational landscape, traditional methods often employ the computation of quantum geometric tensor, consequently complicating optimization techniques. Contributing to efforts aiming to formulate alternative methods, we introduce an approach that bypasses the computation of the metric tensor and instead relies exclusively on first-order gradient descent with Euclidean metric. This allows for the application of larger neural networks and the use of more standard optimization methods from other machine learning domains. Our approach leverages the principle of imaginary time evolution by constructing a target wave function derived from the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, and then training the neural network to approximate this target. We make this method adaptive and stable by determining the optimal time step and keeping the target fixed until the energy of the NQS decreases. We demonstrate the benefits of our scheme via numerical experiments with 2D J1--J2 Heisenberg model, which showcase enhanced stability and energy accuracy in comparison to direct energy loss minimization. Importantly, our approach displays competitiveness with the wellestablished density matrix renormalization group method and NQS optimization with stochastic reconfiguration.},

The paradigm, becoming known as reservoir computing, greatly facilitated the practical application of RNNs and outperformed classical fully trained RNNs in many tasks. It has lately become a vivid research field with numerous extensions of the basic idea, including reservoir adaptation, thus broadening the initial paradigm to using different methods for training the reservoir and the readout. This review systematically surveys both current ways of generating/adapting the reservoirs and training different types of readouts. It offers a natural conceptual classification of the techniques, which transcends boundaries of the current ``brand-names'' of reservoir methods, and thus aims to help in unifying the field and providing the reader with a detailed ``map'' of it.},

  abstract = {The field of neural quantum states has recently experienced a tremendous progress, making them a competitive tool of computational quantum many-body physics. However, their largest achievements to date mostly concern interacting spin systems, while their utility for quantum chemistry remains yet to be demonstrated. Two main complications are the peaked structure of the molecular wave functions, which impedes sampling, and large number of terms in second quantised Hamiltonians, which hinders scaling to larger molecule sizes. In this paper we address these issues jointly and argue that the peaked structure might actually be key to drastically more efficient calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm for autoregressive sampling without replacement and a procedure to calculate a computationally cheaper surrogate for the local energy. We complement them with a custom modification of the stochastic reconfiguration optimisation technique and a highly optimised GPU implementation. As a result, our calculations require substantially less resources and exhibit more than order of magnitude speedup compared to the previous works. On a single GPU we study molecules comprising up to 118 qubits and outperform the ``golden standard'' CCSD(T) benchmark in Hilbert spaces of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ Slater determinants, which is orders of magnitude larger than what was previously achieved. We believe that our work underscores the prospect of NQS for challenging quantum chemistry calculations and serves as a favourable ground for the future method development.},

We present quantum algorithms for the variational optimization of wavefunctions correlated by products of unitary operators, such as Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatzes, using stochastic reconfiguration and the linear method. While an implementation on classical computing hardware would require exponentially growing compute cost, the cost (number of circuits and shots) of our quantum algorithms is polynomial in system size. We find that classical simulations of optimization with the linear method consistently find lower energy solutions than with the L-BFGS-B optimizer across the dissociation curves of the notoriously difficult N\$\_2\$ and C\$\_2\$ dimers; LUCJ predictions of the ground-state energies deviate from exact diagonalization by 1 kcal/mol or less at all points on the potential energy curve. While we do characterize the effect of shot noise on the LM optimization, these noiseless results highlight the critical but often overlooked role that optimization techniques must play in attacking the electronic structure problem (on both classical and quantum hardware), for which even mean-field optimization is formally NP hard. We also discuss the challenge of obtaining smooth curves in these strongly correlated regimes, and propose a number of quantum-friendly solutions ranging from symmetry-projected ansatz forms to a symmetry-constrained optimization algorithm.},

However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation is a classical integrable equation which contains plenty of significant properties and occurs in many physical areas. However, due to the difficulty of solving this equation, in particular in high dimensions, lots of methods are proposed to effectively obtain different kinds of solutions, such as neural networks among others. Recently, a method where some underlying physical laws are embeded into a conventional neural network is proposed to uncover the equation's dynamical behaviors from spatiotemporal data directly. Compared with traditional neural networks, this method can obtain remarkably accurate solution with extraordinarily less data. Meanwhile, this method also provides a better physical explanation and generalization. In this paper, based on the above method, we present an improved deep learning method to recover the soliton solutions, breather solution, and rogue wave solutions of the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. In particular, the dynamical behaviors and error analysis about the one-order and two-order rogue waves of nonlinear integrable equations are revealed by the deep neural network with physical constraints for the first time. Moreover, the effects of different numbers of initial points sampled, collocation points sampled, network layers, neurons per hidden layer on the one-order rogue wave dynamics of this equation have been considered with the help of the control variable way under the same initial and boundary conditions. Numerical experiments show that the dynamical behaviors of soliton solutions, breather solution, and rogue wave solutions of the integrable nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation can be well reconstructed by utilizing this physically-constrained deep learning method.},

  abstract = {Neural-network architectures have been increasingly used to represent quantum many-body wave functions. These networks require a large number of variational parameters and are challenging to optimize using traditional methods, as gradient descent. Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) has been effective with a limited number of parameters, but becomes impractical beyond a few thousand parameters. Here, we leverage a simple linear algebra identity to show that SR can be employed even in the deep learning scenario. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by optimizing a Deep Transformer architecture with \$3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ parameters, achieving state-of-the-art ground-state energy in the \$J\_1\$-\$J\_2\$ Heisenberg model at \$J\_2/J\_1=0.5\$ on the \$10{\textbackslash}times10\$ square lattice, a challenging benchmark in highly-frustrated magnetism. This work marks a significant step forward in the scalability and efficiency of SR for Neural-Network Quantum States, making them a promising method to investigate unknown quantum phases of matter, where other methods struggle.},

  abstract = {Natural gradient (NG) is an information-geometric optimization method that plays a crucial role, especially in the estimation of parameters for machine learning models like neural networks. To apply NG to quantum systems, the quantum natural gradient (QNG) was introduced and utilized for noisy intermediate-scale devices. Additionally, a mathematically equivalent approach to QNG, known as the stochastic reconfiguration method, has been implemented to enhance the performance of quantum Monte Carlo methods. It is worth noting that these methods are based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, which is one of the monotone metrics. So far, monotonicity has been believed to be a guiding principle to construct a geometry in physics. In this paper, we propose generalized QNG by removing the condition of monotonicity. Initially, we demonstrate that monotonicity is a crucial condition for conventional QNG to be optimal. Subsequently, we provide analytical and numerical evidence showing that non-monotone QNG outperforms conventional QNG based on the SLD metric in terms of convergence speed.},

By taking advantage of its tunable governing dynamics, we show that sufficiently strong nonlinear dynamics allows our soliton-based solution to perform accurate regression and classification tasks of non-linear separable datasets. At a conceptual level, the results presented pave a way for the physical realization of novel hardware solutions and have the potential to inspire future research on soliton-based computing using various physical platforms, leveraging its ubiquity across multiple fields of science, from nonlinear optical media to quantum systems.},

  abstract = {We report a systematic study of the weak chemical bond between two benzene molecules. We first show that it is possible to obtain a very good description of the C2 dimer and the benzene molecule by using pseudopotentials for the chemically inert 1s electrons and a resonating valence bond wave function as a variational ansatz, expanded on a relatively small Gaussian basis set. We employ an improved version of the stochastic reconfiguration technique to optimize the many-body wave function, which is the starting point for highly accurate simulations based on the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo method. This projection technique provides a rigorous variational upper bound for the total energy, even in the presence of pseudopotentials, and substantially improves the accuracy of the trial wave function, which already yields a large fraction of the dynamical and nondynamical electron correlation. We show that the energy dispersion of two benzene molecules in the parallel displaced geometry is significantly deeper than the face-to-face configuration. However, contrary to previous studies based on post-Hartree-Fock methods, the binding energy remains weak ({$\simeq$}2kcal/mol) also in this geometry, and its value is in agreement with the most accurate and recent experimental findings [H. Krause et al., Chem. Phys. Lett.\hphantom{,}184, 411 (1991)].},

Optical computing has been rediscovered as a potential solution for large-scale data processing, taking advantage of linear optical accelerators that perform operations at lower power consumption. However, to achieve efficient computing with light, it remains a challenge to create and control nonlinearity optically rather than electronically. In this study, a reservoir computing approach (RC) is investigated using a 14-mm waveguide in LiNbO3 on an insulator as an optical processor to validate the benefit of optical nonlinearity. Data are encoded on the spectrum of a femtosecond pulse, which is launched into the waveguide. The output of the waveguide is a nonlinear transform of the input, enabled by optical nonlinearities. We show experimentally that a simple digital linear classifier using the output spectrum of the waveguide increases the classification accuracy of several databases by {$\sim$}10\% compared to untransformed data. In comparison, a digital neural network (NN) with tens of thousands of parameters was required to achieve similar accuracy. With the ability to reduce the number of parameters by a factor of at least 20, an integrated optical RC approach can attain a performance on a par with a digital NN.},

The unscented transformation (UT) approach is applied to model the demand uncertainty due to its being simple to implement and requiring no assumptions to simplify it. A human-inspired intelligent method named improved mountaineering team-based optimization (IMTBO) is used to find the decision variables defined as the network's optimal configuration. The conventional MTBO is improved using a quasi-opposition-based learning strategy to overcome premature convergence and achieve the optimal solution. The simulation results showed that in single- and double-objective optimization some objectives are weakened compared to their base value, while the results of the MOIF indicate a fair compromise between different objectives, and all objectives are enhanced. The results of the MOIF based on the IMTBO clearly showed that the losses are reduced by 30.94\%, the voltage sag numbers and average RMS fluctuation are reduced by 33.68\% and 33.65\%, and also ASIFI, MAIFI, and SAIFI are improved by 6.80\%, 44.61\%, and 0.73\%, respectively. Also, the superior capability of the MOIF based on the IMTBO is confirmed compared to the conventional MTBO, particle swarm optimization, and the artificial electric field algorithm. Moreover, the results of the stochastic MOIF based on the UT showed the power loss increased by 7.62\%, voltage sag and SARFI increased by 5.39\% and 5.31\%, and ASIFI, MAIFI, and SAIFI weakened by 2.28\%, 6.61\%, and 1.48\%, respectively, compared to the deterministic MOIF model.},
